# Atelier Lelu's random components

This repo is a public dump of some components I use or have used and could not find a good symbol/footprint/3d model for.
The 3d models are exported as STEP files (with colours!) but the symbol and footprint files are for Kicad because that's what I use.
Please use at your own risk and double check everything :)
